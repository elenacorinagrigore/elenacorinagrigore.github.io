	{\bf Prediction and Behavior Modeling team}\vspace{0.5em}\\
      	%Working on the Prediction and Behavior Modeling team, focusing on road actors present in the environment of the autonomous vehicle (e.g., vehicles, bicyclists, pedestrians, etc.). Applying machine learning techniques (notably, deep learning) to model and predict the trajectories and intentions of such agents.
      	Working on the Prediction and Behavior Modeling team, applying machine learning techniques (notably, deep learning) to model and predict the trajectories and intentions of all the agents of interest in the environment of a self-driving vehicle~\cite{grigore2020covernet}, \cite{grigore2020self_driving_domain_knowledge}.
	
	{\it Outcome:} Utilizing and expanding my research skills to develop models of how agents behave on the road, and to publish state-of-the-art solutions to top machine learning conferences. Applying large-scale deep learning models to real-world, large datasets involving temporal data. Utilizing my knowledge of Python and PyTorch, being part of the full process of creating and deploying deep learning models. Working in a dynamic and fast-paced team with strong collaboration practices, as well as working with other teams to understand data constraints and establish interfacing between modules.
	
\item \thing{\bf Research Intern at Uber Advanced Technologies Group, San Francisco, USA}{2017}\\
        {\bf Deep learning for self-driving car perception team}\vspace{0.5em}\\
        Worked on the perception module of the self-driving pipeline, where the aim was to detect all targets of interest in the environment of the autonomous vehicle. Researched introducing temporal context into deep learning networks, including the use of multi-frames and recurrent neural networks.
	
	{\it Outcome:} Gained experience using large scale deep learning models for detection, and developed research skills relevant to working with region-based convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Gained experience using the Google Object Detection codebase, TensorFlow, and its associated utilities for working with large datasets (e.g., TFRecords). Worked in a fast-paced team, and collaborated with colleagues to implement novel ideas for the team's deep learning models.
