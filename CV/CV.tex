	Applying machine learning techniques to endow robots with learning capabilities needed when placed in new environments or faced with new tasks. This includes learning about the structure and progression of a physical task, as well as about the actions human workers perform during this task. Investigating techniques including Hidden Markov Models and reinforcement learning in single- and multi-agent settings, where the robot's aim is to provide supportive behaviors in human-robot collaboration scenarios.

\item \thing{\bf Research Scientist at nuTonomy, Boston, USA}{2018 -- present}\\
	{\bf Behavior Modeling team}\vspace{0.5em}\\
      	Working as part of the Behavioral Modeling team, focusing on the agents of interest present in the self-driving car's environment (e.g., vehicles, bicyclists, pedestrians, etc.). Applying machine learning techniques (including deep learning) to model and predict the trajectories and intentions of such agents.
	
	{\it Outcome:} Utilizing and expanding my research skills to create and build models of how agents behave on the road. Applying large-scale deep learning models (including recurrent neural networks) to real-world, large datasets involving temporal data. Gaining and solidifying knowledge in using PyTorch, being part of the full process of creating and deploying deep learning models. Working in a dynamic and fast-paced team with strong collaboration practices, as well as working with other teams to understand data constraints and establish interfacing between modules.
	
\item \thing{\bf Research Intern at Uber Advanced Technologies Group, San Francisco, USA}{2017}\\
        {\bf Deep learning for self-driving car perception team}\vspace{0.5em}\\
        Worked on the perception module of the self-driving pipeline, where the aim was to detect all targets of interest in the environment of the autonomous vehicle. Researched introducing temporal context into deep learning networks, including the use of multi-frames and recurrent neural networks.
	
	{\it Outcome:} Gained experience using large scale deep learning models for detection, and developed research skills relevant to working with region-based convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Gained experience using the newly released Google Object Detection codebase, TensorFlow, and its associated utilities for working with large datasets (e.g., TFRecords). Worked in a fast-paced team, and collaborated with colleagues to implement novel ideas for the team's deep learning models.
		
\item \thing{\bf Student-teacher at Sidney Stringer School, Coventry, UK}{2009}\\
        {\bf The Student Associates Scheme, UK}\vspace{0.5em}\\
	Worked within the Mathematics Department as a student-teacher providing help for students during classes, raising students' aspirations for higher education. Produced and delivered presentations and a programming-based project and also delivered a lesson. 
	
	{\it Outcome:} Developed communication, presentation and leadership skills, effectively coordinated groups of students and worked together with teachers and other student-teachers in a motivating environment.

%\item \thing{\bf Course Representative, Coventry University, Coventry, UK}{2008 -- 2009}\\
%	Speaking on behalf of the students to improve communication between lecturers and students and to solve any course-related problems.
%	
%	{\it Outcome:} Persuasion and negotiation skills gained from taking part in meetings with lecturers and staff where representing the students’ point of view.
